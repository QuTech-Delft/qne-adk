# Quantum Network Explorer ADK

The QNE-ADK is a Quantum Network Explorer - Application Development Kit that allows you to create your own applications and experiments and run them on a simulator.

## Local development

With the ADK you can create your own application from scratch using the ``qne application create`` command
(see Commands below). An application directory is created with all the necessary files for you to configure.
When configuring an application, you specify the different roles and what types of inputs your
application uses. In addition, you write the functionality of your application using the NetQASM library.

After creating and configuring an application, you can create an experiment for it using the ``qne experiment create``
command. A separate experiment directory is created with all the necessary files. When configuring your experiment
you can give values to the inputs that were specified when creating your application. You also choose which channels
and nodes you use in your network and which role is linked to which node. A network consists of channels and each
channel consists of two nodes. The nodes can communicate with each other using the channel between them.

Once your experiment is configured you are ready to run it using the ``qne experiment run`` command. Your experiment
is parsed and sent to the NetSquid simulator. After some time your experiment run will be finished and a results
directory will be generated in which all the results of your experiment are stored. An alternative is to use the
``qne experiment results`` command to show the results on screen.

## Remote development

Instead of starting from scratch an existing application can be cloned using the ``qne application clone`` command.
A copy of a working application is made to your application directory and can be used as starting point
for application development.

A tested application can be uploaded and published after which it can be selected by other users on the QNE
website. After uploading the application ``qne application upload`` a remote experiment must be created and run on the
QNE backends successfully before the application can be published ``qne application publish``.

## Prerequisites
- A modern Linux or macOS (10 or 11) 64-bit (x86_64) operating system. If you donâ€™t have Linux or macOS you could run it via virtualization, e.g. using VirtualBox. If you have Windows 10 or 11 you can also use the [Bash on Ubuntu](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) subsystem.
- A [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) should be created and activated before creating an application.
- Python version 3.7 or higher and pip version 19 or higher.
- NetQASM makes use of SquidASM for which you need credentials in order to use it. These credentials can be obtained by registering on the forum of [NetSquid](https://forum.netsquid.org/).

## Installation
To install all the required packages, execute the following command:

```
pip install qne-adk
```

After installing the qne-adk, you can install SquidASM. Replace '{netsquid-user-name}' and '{netsquid-password}' with the credentials you registered on [NetSquid](https://forum.netsquid.org/):

```
pip install squidasm --extra-index-url=https://{netsquid-user-name}:{netsquid-password}@pypi.netsquid.org
```

Now everything should be setup and ready in order to create your own applications and experiments and run them on the simulator!
