# Quantum Network Explorer ADK

The QNE-ADK is a Quantum Network Explorer - Application Development Kit that allows you to create your own applications
and experiments and run them on a simulator.

## Local development

With the ADK you can create your own application from scratch using the ``qne application create`` command
(see section 'Commands' below for more information about the individual commands). An application directory is created
with all the necessary files for you to configure. When configuring an application, you specify the different roles
and what types of inputs your application uses. In addition, you write the functionality of your application using the
NetQASM library.

After creating and configuring an application, you can create an experiment for it using the ``qne experiment create``
command. A separate experiment directory is created with all the necessary files. When configuring your experiment
you can give values to the inputs that were specified when creating your application. You also choose which channels
and nodes you use in your network and which role is linked to which node. A network consists of channels and each
channel consists of two nodes. The nodes can communicate with each other using the channel between them.

Once your experiment is configured you are ready to run it using the ``qne experiment run`` command. Your experiment
is parsed and sent to the NetSquid simulator. After some time your experiment run will be finished and a results
directory will be generated in which all the results of your experiment are stored. An alternative is to use the
``qne experiment results`` command to show the results on screen.

## Publishing applications

When your application is finished and you want to share it with the world, an application can be uploaded and
published after which it can be selected by other users on the QNE platform. After uploading the application
``qne application upload`` a remote experiment must be created ``qne experiment create --remote`` and run
``qne experiment run`` first on the QNE simulator backend successfully before the application can be
published ``qne application publish``. After the application is published successfully, it can be used by others.
For commands interacting with the remote QNE server you must log in first ``qne login``.

Instead of starting from scratch an existing QNE application can be cloned using the ``qne application clone`` command.
A copy of a working application is made to your application directory and can be used as starting point
for application development.

## Prerequisites

- A modern Linux or macOS (10 or 11) 64-bit (x86_64) operating system. If you don’t have Linux or macOS you could run
  it via virtualization, e.g. using VirtualBox. If you have Windows 10 or 11 you can also use
  the [Bash on Ubuntu](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) subsystem.
- A [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) should be created and activated before creating
  an application.
- Python version 3.8 or higher.
- NetQASM makes use of SquidASM for which you need credentials in order to use it. These credentials can be obtained
  by registering on the forum of [NetSquid](https://forum.netsquid.org/).

## Installation

To install all the required packages, execute the following command:

```
pip install qne-adk
```

After installing the qne-adk, you can install SquidASM. Replace '{netsquid-user-name}' and '{netsquid-password}' with
the credentials you registered on [NetSquid](https://forum.netsquid.org/):

```
pip install squidasm --extra-index-url=https://{netsquid-user-name}:{netsquid-password}@pypi.netsquid.org
```

Now everything should be setup and ready in order to create your own applications and experiments and run them on the
simulator!

## Troubleshooting

If you have any issues installing SquidASM (e.g. it only seems to use version 0.0.1), check the following:

- Make sure you're using the latest version of `pip` (run: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`)
- Check you're using a supported Python version [here](https://pypi.netsquid.org/netsquid/). In the wheel filenames,
  cpXX indicates the version - so if you have Python 3.10, but there is no cp310 wheel, switch to a supported version
  of Python. Check the OS is also compatible.
- If `pydynaa` is failing, check the same as above [here](https://pypi.netsquid.org/pydynaa/).
- For help with Python versions, check out [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). You should probably be
  using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) too.
