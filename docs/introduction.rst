Introduction
============

The QNE-ADK is a Quantum Network Explorer - Application Development Kit that allows you to create your own applications
and experiments and run them on a simulator.

Local development
-----------------

With the ADK you can create your own application from scratch using the ``qne application create`` command
(see Commands below). An application directory is created with all the necessary files for you to configure.
When configuring an application, you specify the different roles and what types of inputs your
application uses. In addition, you write the functionality of your application using the NetQASM library.

After creating and configuring an application, you can create an experiment for it using the ``qne experiment create``
command. A separate experiment directory is created with all the necessary files. When configuring your experiment
you can give values to the inputs that were specified when creating your application. You also choose which channels
and nodes you use in your network and which role is linked to which node. A network consists of channels and each
channel consists of two nodes. The nodes can communicate with each other using the channel between them.

Once your experiment is configured you are ready to run it using the ``qne experiment run`` command. Your experiment
is parsed and sent to the NetSquid simulator. After some time your experiment run will be finished and a results
directory will be generated in which all the results of your experiment are stored. An alternative is to use the
``qne experiment results`` command to show the results on screen.

Remote development
------------------

Instead of starting from scratch an existing application can be cloned using the ``qne application clone`` command.
A copy of a working application is made to your application directory and can be used as starting point
for application development.

A tested application can be uploaded and published after which it can be selected by other users on the QNE
website. After uploading the application ``qne application upload`` a remote experiment must be created and run on the
QNE backends successfully before the application can be published ``qne application publish``.

Prerequisites
-------------
* A modern Linux or macOS (10 or 11) 64-bit (x86_64) operating system. If you don't have Linux or macOS you could run
  it via virtualization, e.g. using VirtualBox. If you have Windows 10 or 11 you can also use
  the `Bash on Ubuntu <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/>`_ subsystem.
* A `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ should be created and activated before
  creating an application.
* Python version 3.7 or higher and pip version 19 or higher.
* NetQASM makes use of SquidASM for which you need credentials in order to use it. These credentials can be obtained
  by registering on the forum of `NetSquid <https://forum.netsquid.org/>`_.

Installation
------------
To install all the required packages, execute the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install qne-adk

After installing the qne-adk, you can install SquidASM. Replace '{netsquid-user-name}' and '{netsquid-password}' with
the credentials you registered on `NetSquid <https://forum.netsquid.org/>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install squidasm --extra-index-url=https://{netsquid-user-name}:{netsquid-password}@pypi.netsquid.org

Now everything should be setup and ready in order to create your own applications and experiments and run them on
the simulator!

Installation from source
------------------------

The source for the QNE-ADK can also be found at Github. For the default installation execute:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/QuTech-Delft/qne-adk
    cd qne-adk
    pip install .

If you want to install for development, install with:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install -e .[dev]

*Note: installing for development will install packages that are needed to develop the QNE-ADK itself.*

Installing for generating documentation
---------------------------------------
To install the necessary packages to perform documentation activities for QNE-ADK do:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install -e .[rtd]

To build the 'readthedocs' documentation do:

.. code-block:: console

    cd docs
    make html

The documentation is then build in 'docs/_build/html' and can be viewed `here <index.html>`_.

Commands
--------
The QNE-ADK uses various commands to create and run your applications and experiments. All the commands are
listed below:

application list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    qne application list [OPTIONS]

Show a list of all applications and relevant information for each of them.
For listing remote applications, the user must be logged in.

This is needed for applications not created with QNE-ADK, for example when the files come from a
repository or are directly copied to the file system.
Two subdirectories `src` and `config` will be created when not already there.
When application files are in the root directory, but belong to one of the subdirectories, they are moved.

    Arguments:
      APPLICATION_NAME  Name of the application [required]

    Options:
      --help   Show this message and exit.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

application create
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    qne application create [OPTIONS] APPLICATION_NAME ROLES...

Create a new application in your current directory containing all the files that are needed to write your application.
